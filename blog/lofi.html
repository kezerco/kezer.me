<p>BACKGROUND</p>

<p>Early exposure to screens is a pervasive problem in modern parenting –– with insidious, unpredictable, and compounding effects on the long tail of a child’s life. </p>

<p>The standard stance is no screen time before 2 years old. (American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, American Pediatric Association, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, et al.)</p>

<p>However there’s no stance, standard or otherwise, on how to achieve this other than abstain.</p>

<p>I wanted a more proactive and antifragile plan.</p>

<p>PROTOCOL</p>

<p>1/ Pick a minimally stimulating channel (“slow tv” [1], [2]) on YouTube</p>

<p>Editor’s note –– Here's the two I picked:</p>

<p>1A/ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXCB1zGGFiY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXCB1zGGFiY</a> 
This one has movement and no music (a train through the snowy Swiss Alps in winter, 8.5 hours in duration) </p>

<p>1B/ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfKfPfyJRdk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfKfPfyJRdk</a>
This one has music and almost no movement (lofi girl, 3ish hours looping ““animation””)</p>

<p>2/ Subscribe to YouTube Premium to make sure your kid never ever see ads</p>

<p>3/ Leave on 24/7/365 for the next 2+ years</p>

<p>It seems to work immediately ––  as soon as we started (our kid was about 3 months old), he started to ignore screens.</p>

<p>. . .</p>

<p>THESIS</p>

<p>After a lot of reading, my lay understanding of the research was there are neurological implications of screen time under the age of 2 years old because a child’s brain responds with alpha waves (associated with passive, disengaged states). This sharply contrasts with beta waves (linked to active thinking and learning).</p>

<p>Beta waves stem from focused, concerted cognitive effort in problem solving or decision making. Husband and I were already committed to maximizing high agency child development (we’re both Montessori kids). </p>

<p>Thus my primary objective was minimizing any potential interference from screens, whether ours or others. So the task at hand was designing a way to condition my kid that nothing on screens is particularly interesting or engaging.</p>

<p>I remembered reading about public access channels in Norway and decided to run an experiment with slow tv. [1], [2]</p>

<p>I picked two minimally stimulating channels on YouTube. And then we played one of these nearly 24/7/365 for the next 2+ years. </p>

<p>. . .</p>

<p>RESULTS</p>

<p>Anecdotally, at 18 months old, we took him to the eye doctor.</p>

<p>At that young, the exam is done by playing the Pixar movie Cars and saying, “Look over there! Keep looking over there while I'm looking at your eyes!”</p>

<p>The eye doctor quite literally COULD NOT get him to look at the screen. </p>

<p>Now, at almost 3 years old, he still thinks my iPhone is just a phone that calls people.</p>

<p>. . .</p>

<p>FAQ</p>

<p>Q/ My kid is addicted to Cocomelon / insert TV show here. Could this still work for me?</p>

<p>A/ I don’t know but I think it could. DM me @melissa on X if you are willing to try it in the reverse. I’m willing to work with you on it –– it could end up being something that helps a lot of parents.</p>

<p>Q/ Do you have any recommended reading on the neurological implications of screen time? </p>
